# Space Haven Mods

An unofficial collection of mods for Space Haven by Bugbyte. Requires the [unofficial mod loader](https://github.com/anatarist/spacehaven-modloader) to use.

All of the mods are downloadable from [the releases page](https://github.com/anatarist/spacehaven-mods/releases).


## Couchsurfing

A comfort and decoration expansion.

New decorative items:
- Captain's chair
- Computer terminal
- Artifical plant
- Hologram projector
- Flipped 2x3 couch

Movement and placement tweaks:
- Characters can now squeeze past couches and chairs, although with a movement penalty, so you can place them in more crowded spaces.
- Couches no longer require free space on each end so you can make Us and other shapes.


## Greenhouse

A rebalance of crop growth to take advantage of the game's temperature and gas systems.

Crop Growth Rebalance:
- Root vegetables now require a temperature range of 0C - 20C.
- Fruits now require a higher light level and a temperature range of 25C - 40C, which means you can't grow them next to root vegetables.
- Artificial meat now requires a temperature of 50C - 95C, 4x more CO2, and produces hazard gas when harvested. You'll need an area that's isolated from the rest of the ship to grow it.


## Extreme Ventilation

Expands on the game's gas simulation system.

New Ventilation Components:
- An exterior air vent that wall-mounts on side of your ship. Useful for emergency venting and to maintain hard vacuums in e.g. industrial areas. Available under ship > airlock.

New Gas Generators:
- A smoke generator that burns Carbon and produces large amounts of smoke.
- A hazard gas generator that burns Hyperium. Use it to test your emergency preparadness, or maybe repel boarders?
