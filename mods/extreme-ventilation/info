    <name>Extreme Ventilation</name>
    <description>Expands on the game's gas simulation system.

New Ventilation Components:
- An exterior air vent that wall-mounts on side of your ship. Useful for emergency venting and to maintain hard vacuums in e.g. industrial areas. Available under ship > airlock.

New Gas Generators:
- A smoke generator that burns Carbon and produces large amounts of smoke.
- A hazard gas generator that burns Hyperium. Use it to test your emergency preparedness, or maybe repel boarders?

NOTE: This mod is a drop-in replacement for the "Exterior Air Vent" example mod included with the mod loader.
