  <description>A comfort and decoration expansion.

New Decorative Items:
- An artifical plant that provides a small comfort bonus in otherwise uncomfortable areas
- A "Player Faction" hologram projector
- A computer terminal

Couches and Chairs:
- Characters can now squeeze past couches and chairs, although with a movement penalty, so you can place them in more crowded spaces
- Couches no longer require free space on each end so you can make Us and other shapes
- Adds a flipped variant of the 1x2 couch
