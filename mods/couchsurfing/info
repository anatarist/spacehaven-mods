  <description>Relaxes restrictions on couches and chairs.
- Characters can now squeeze past couches and chairs, although with a movement penalty, so you can place them in more crowded spaces.
- Couches no longer require free space on each end so you can make Us and other shapes.
- Adds a flipped variant of the 1x2 couch.</description>
