    <description>A comfort and decoration expansion.

New decorative items:
- Captain's chair
- Computer terminal
- Artifical plant
- Hologram projector
- Flipped 2x3 couch

Movement and placement tweaks:
- Characters can now squeeze past couches and chairs, although with a movement penalty, so you can place them in more crowded spaces.
- Couches no longer require free space on each end so you can make Us and other shapes.

Note: This mod is a drop-in replacement for the "Artificial Plant" example mod included with the mod loader.
