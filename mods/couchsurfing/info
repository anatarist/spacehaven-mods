  <description>Adds new decorative items and relaxes restrictions on couches and chairs.
- Adds an artifical plant that provides a small comfort bonus in otherwise uncomfortable areas.
- Adds a hologram of your faction.
- Characters can now squeeze past couches and chairs, although with a movement penalty, so you can place them in more crowded spaces.
- Couches no longer require free space on each end so you can make Us and other shapes.
- Adds a flipped variant of the 1x2 couch.</description>
