  <description>A rebalance of crop growth to take advantage of the game's temperature and gas systems.

- Root vegetables require a temperature range of 0C - 20C.
- Fruits now require a higher light level and a temperature range of 25C - 40C, which means you can't grow them next to root vegetables.
- Artificial meat now requires a temperature of 50C - 95C, 4x more CO2, and produces hazard gas when harvested. You'll need an area that's isolated from the rest of the ship to grow it.
